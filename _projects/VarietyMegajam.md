This is my first attempt to do the [Variety MEGAJAM](https://itch.io/jam/variety-megajam-3). It's a game jame where you 10 games in 10 different genres in 10 days!  

The theme of the jam is a bunch of [business abbreviations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_business_and_finance_abbreviations) which explains the names of each game. Check out the itch.io link above to play all 10 games for free in the browser (desktop-only)!  

Also, I did [20x timelapses](/timelapses) for each game, so check those out if you want to see how all these games were developed.
