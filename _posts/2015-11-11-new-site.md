**Hey everyone!**

Welcome to my new website. It's still under construction and needs some polish and a couple of features, but it's presentable. It's a lot better than my old website, which I made almost two years ago and it never really felt right.

For this new website, I had a few requirements:

* Hosted on Github
* Blogging system
* Easy to add content
* Not made from scratch

Clearly, Jekyll is the perfect fit for these requirements. It's a static blog site generator that has tight Github integration, and it has a lot of support and existing themes to use. I should've had another requirement: _not a huge pain to customize_, but I'll write another post about that later...

Anyway, I found this nice minimalistic theme and heavily customized it to have a desaturated colorful look. Maybe customized too much, but I couldn't resist.

So go ahead and check out my [posts](./words) and [projects](./things) and feel free to give me some feedback on twitter [@foolmoron](twitter.com/foolmoron) or any social platform using the icons at the top of the page!
