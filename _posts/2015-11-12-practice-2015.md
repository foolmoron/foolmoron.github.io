[NYU Practice](http://gamecenter.nyu.edu/practice/) is an amazing game design conference held every year the the NYU Game Center in NYC. It's probably my favorite game conference that I went to last year, so I'm really excited for this year's conference. There are so many amazing designers who have an unbelievable amount of knowledge to share, it's just pure bliss.

So that's what I'm doing with my weekend. Unfortunately that means I can't work on my site or on [Clash Cup Turbo](http://www.clashcupturbo.com) for a while. My web developer friend and [ROOT 76](http://www.root76.io) partner [Harris Weaver](http://www.harrisweaver.com) gave me a really great idea on how to improve the look of the site, so I hope I can get that done soon.

But for now, I have to prepare for the drive up to NYC!
